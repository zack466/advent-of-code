## Advent of Code 2022

This year, I'm trying to the problems as fast as possible, so please keep that in mind when reading this code (it is not intended to be clean, concise, nor robust).
For certain problems, I may simply comment out certain lines of code in order to do part 2 instead of adding in more code or rewriting to allow for different parameters, etc.
Also, for whatever reason I decided to minify my solutions for days 2 and 3 - just ignore those lol.
