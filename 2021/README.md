# Advent of Code Gun Game
## This year, I will try to do each day's problems in a different programming language (because why not?)

So, I realized something about this challenge: it's kind of pointless.
At the beginning, I thought it be interesting, but it's really not.
Most of the time, I can think of a solution, and then I just end up wanting to reach for Python.
Instead, I have to search up builtins/standard library functions for I/O, math, list manipulation, etc over and over.
I'm not saying that I don't want to learn new languages, but I think that this challenge is not the right way to do it.
While it's been fun, I think I'm just going to go ahead and do the rest of the challenges in whatever language I want.
